# Description: This file contains the mapping between the SSPs and the IAM scenarios.
#   The SSPs are defined in the SSP database (https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about).
#   The IAM scenarios are defined in the IAMC 1.5°C Scenario Explorer and Data hosted by IIASA (https://data.ene.iiasa.ac.at/iamc-1.5c-explorer/#/home).
#   For a full overview of premise scenarios go to (https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)
